# DAILY CSS IMAGES

#dailycssimages

Just started this challenge 16th October 2018 - I believe it is now closed, what a shame! I signed up for it 16th Jan 2017 and didn't get round to starting it because of well ... life, stuff happens. Anyway, I just recently found all the emails I was sent that I had saved in a separate folder and now commit myself to finish this wonderful CSS images challenge. Mega gratitude to the creator Mike Mangialardi!

#### Daily Challenges

* #### Daily CSS Images :: 01 Bear Cub

The challenge begins! Don't overthink it. A cub can be made in only a few shapes.

My attempt: My first day went well, I feel it looks like a bear, kept it simple with just a few shapes.

* #### Daily CSS Images :: 02 Elephant

Remember that simple is usually better.
Just a face will do, but you can do more if you'd like.
Dumbo? Peanuts? What will be your take?

My attempt: OMG, so my attempt looks hideous haha, the trunk especially needs work and the face reminds me of Thomas the tank engine but with a trunk.  The main thing is I had fun and it's giving my CSS skills a boost.  Every day I will improve.  Should of kept this simple.

* #### Daily CSS Images :: 03 Beaver

Think about how you can continue to keep it simple, but give this a personal touch.

My attempt: It looks better than the elephant!  I am actually pleased with how this turned out.

* #### Daily CSS Images :: 04 Tiger

Don't worry. It can be still be cute and simple. Just a face is still perfectly ok.

After a very long break away from this challenge, I have picked up where I had left it, on the Tiger.  After a very rough few years, I am back today 25/04/2020 to finish this challenge.

My attempt: Day four the Tiger went well and I am pleased with the result, I kept it simple.

* #### Daily CSS Images :: 05 Favorite Animated Animal

End the animal series with a bang!  Dig deep and pull out that creativity.
Dory? Snoopy?  What animated animal would you like to showcase?

My attempt:
