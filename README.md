# DAILY CSS IMAGES

#dailycssimages

Just started this challenge 16th October 2018 - I believe it is now closed, what a shame! I signed up for it 16th Jan 2017 and didn't get round to starting it because of well ... life, stuff happens. Anyway, I just recently found all the emails I was sent that I had saved in a separate folder and now commit myself to finish this wonderful CSS images challenge. Mega gratitude to the creator Mike Mangialardi!
