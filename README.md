# DAILY CSS IMAGES

#dailycssimages

Just started this challenge 16th October 2018 - I believe it is now closed, what a shame! I signed up for it 16th Jan 2017 and didn't get round to starting it because of well ... life, stuff happens. Anyway, I just recently found all the emails I was sent that I had saved in a separate folder and now commit myself to finish this wonderful CSS images challenge. Mega gratitude to the creator Mike Mangialardi!

#### Daily Challenges

* #### Daily CSS Images :: 01 Bear Cub

The challenge begins! Don't overthink it. A cub can be made in only a few shapes.

My first day went well, I feel it looks like a bear, kept it simple with just a few shapes.

* #### Daily CSS Images :: 02 Elephant

Remember that simple is usually better.
Just a face will do, but you can do more if you'd like.
Dumbo? Peanuts? What will be your take?

Ok, so my attempt looks kinda hideous haha, the trunk especially needs work but I had fun.  Every day I will improve.
